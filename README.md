## Introduction

The Shopping List application allows users to create and manage shopping lists with ease. The app provides a user-friendly interface where users can add, edit, and delete items, filter items by category, and confirm actions before discarding changes.

## Aesthetics and Design

The application focuses on a minimalist and cohesive design. Key design elements include:
- **Unified Styles**: Consistent use of grey color for components like checkboxes and buttons.
- **Custom Borders**: Edit texts have an extra border added using a custom background XML file.
- **Circular Icons**: Icons in the shopping list activity are placed in circular backgrounds using another background XML file.

## Features

1. **Back Button Confirmation**:
   - When the user tries to return to the shopping list activity before finishing a new item, a confirmation dialog is displayed to confirm if they wish to discard the item and return.
